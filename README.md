# TrailInfo

This TrailInfo CLI GEM is programmed to allow the user to select a state and then display available trails in that state from TrailLink.com. Users are then able to select a trail from that list to see further details about the trail. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trail_info'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trail_info

## Usage

To use TrailInfo, run ./bin/trail_info in your terminal. A list of states will be displayed, select one by number and hit enter to bring up trails in that state. When the trail list populates, enter a trail number and hit enter to see further details on the selected trail. Use menu commands to navigate back to the start. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
