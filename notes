Future ideas:
  -find by name
  -add all cities
  -adds detail option for each trail

for added searchability:
  def self.print_all
    all.each_with_index do |trail, index|
      puts "#{i}. #{trail.name} | Length: #{trail.length} | Surface: #{trail.surface}|"
    end
  end

  def self.trails_by_state(state)
    trail_list = []
    self.all.each do |trail|
      if trail.state.name == selected_state.name
        trail_list << trail
     end
    end
  end
