a CLI for TrailLink
http://www.traillink.com/stateactivity/al-hiking-trails.aspx

user types 'find a trail'

-runs executable (bin/trail_info)

Lists country locations (".box.content.link-list")

"Which Country would you like?"

user selects location

Lists State locations (".box.content.link-list")

"Which State would you like?"

user selects location

Lists City locations (".box.content.link-list")

user selects location

List of trails displayed (".container-body")

-Trail info displayed: Difficulty, Length, Duration, Notes

reset option

*Have a go back option on all scripts


Future ideas:
  -find by name
  -add all cities




    #||= gets data the first time but not if it already has it
    #Have CLI create new trail lists and report back the list

Things to fix:
-Output text
-commas at the end of some surface attributes
-exit function
