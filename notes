  def self.scrape_all
    trails = [
      trail_name,
      trail_length,
      etc.
    ]

    [0...trail_data.size]t_a.each do |i| #amt of items inside trails array
      trail_name = trails[0][i]
      trail_length = trails[1][i]
    end
      trail = Trail.new
      trail.name = name
      trail.length = trail_length
      trail.save
  end    
end

    #||= gets data the first time but not if it already has it
    #Have CLI create new trail lists and report back the list
